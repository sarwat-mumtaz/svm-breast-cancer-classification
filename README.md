##Breast Cancer Classification with SVM using scikit-learn

This project explores the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for breast cancer classification using the scikit-learn library in Python. The goal is to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on features extracted from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies.

Project Structure:

svm_breast_cancer.py: Script containing the implementation.
requirements.txt: File listing dependencies. (Optional)
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
Steps:

Load the Dataset:

Uses load_breast_cancer from scikit-learn to load the dataset.
Stores features and target labels in a Pandas DataFrame.
Split the Dataset:

Uses train_test_split to split the data into training and testing sets.
Ensures a 20% split for testing using test_size=0.2.
Employs random_state for reproducibility.
Preprocess the Data:

Uses StandardScaler to scale features for consistent units.
Scales both training and testing data using the same scaler object.
Train the SVM Model:

Creates an SVM model with a linear kernel and a regularization parameter C=1.
Trains the model on the training data using the fit method.
Evaluate the Model:

Uses predict to predict class labels for the testing data.
Calculates accuracy score and classification report using scikit-learn metrics.
Reports precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
Make Predictions:

Allows predictions on new data points using the trained model.
Demonstrates how to reshape a single data point for prediction.
Running the Project:

Clone the repository (if applicable).
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (if using requirements.txt)
Run the script: python svm_breast_cancer.py
Conclusion:

This project provides a basic implementation of SVM for breast cancer classification. You can extend this by:

Trying different SVM kernels (e.g., polynomial, RBF)
Tuning hyperparameters for potentially better performance
Exploring feature engineering techniques
Building more complex models for classification
